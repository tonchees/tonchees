- 👋 Hi, I’m @tonchees, I'm a professional digital marketer with a strong background in PPC and web analytics.
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in broadening my knowledge in the field of programming and automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python as my first actual coding language besides some HTML/CSS basic knowledge. Next on the menu will probably be JS.
